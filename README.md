This project aims to compare the performance of algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort) using a classic sequential approach versus a parallelized implementation with Java's Fork/Join framework.

It includes a basic function benchmarking utility: functions are timed for batches of generic input values (as long as the values implement the Comparable interface, allowing them to be sorted). Execution times are plotted against the size of the input values.

This project is essentially a sandbox where I experiment with various Java features: generics, parallelism, reflection...
